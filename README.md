## Overview

StockPredictor leverages machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The project uses the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to enhance prediction accuracy through iterative refinement and backtesting methodologies.

## Features

- Historical data analysis
- Machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier) for prediction
- Iterative model refinement
- Backtesting for model validation
- Evaluation metrics calculation (precision improvement)

## Installation

To run the StockPredictor project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/StockPredictor.git
   cd StockPredictor


### Notes:
- Replace placeholders like `your-username` and adjust paths (`data/stock_data.csv`) as per your actual repository structure.
- Ensure to have a `requirements.txt` file listing dependencies if you have specific packages required.
- Customize sections like `Overview`, `Features`, `Usage`, `Dataset`, `Model Training`, and `Evaluation` with specific details and results from your project.
